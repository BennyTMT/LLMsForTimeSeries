# TS_Models

## Is LLM truly necessary in time series analysis?

### In this version, I did not clean up the code to preserve its original state during my runtim; this is to avoid removing any potential bugs that might be present in experiments (As shown in our meeting)

## Run OFA experiments
cd ./OFA

### For ETT experiments :
   
  bash ./scripts/ETTm_GPT2.sh   
  
  bash ./scripts/ETTm_GPT2.sh
  
### For other datasets, such as illness:

    bash ./scripts/illness.sh 

### For simple metheds, such as illness : 

   bash ./scripts/simple/illness.sh   
### (Please change "itt" parameters in script, if you only want to test)
