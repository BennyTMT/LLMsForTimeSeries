# TS_Models

## Is LLM truly necessary in time series analysis?

### In this version, I did not clean up the code to preserve its original state during my runtim; this is to avoid removing any potential bugs that might be present in experiments (As shown in our meeting)

## Run OFA experiments
1. cd OFA
2. For ETT experiments :
   
  bash ./scripts/ETTm_GPT2.sh   
  
  bash ./scripts/ETTm_GPT2.sh
  
4. For other datasets, such as illness :

    bash ./scripts/illness.sh
